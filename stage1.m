### Stage one is to convert speciments images to grayscale,
### cut not-hole colours (grayscale values). no real magic done here...

# changelog: extended info, any extension support, 
#  resulting images in PNG (lossless but compress), first/lastPeak auto calculation, 
#  filename->diameter new "position", memory optim. 
#  Add left and top margin to speciments so there won't be problem
#  in next stages.
#  Move cutting stuff to stage 0.

#INFO = "After first run go to output_directory/images and check samples coords and histograms on image should be two peaks - one for holes (left one) and one for board color (right)\n firstPeak should be somewhere on the left from local minimum between two main peaks. \nsecondPeak - on the right. Change config variables if it is not. \n\nIf Your samples differs, change sample_coords. \nhint: use gimp to find coords and size or calculate it its important to remove (not include) anything that is not a hole ie. edge od sample. \n\nAlso it is good moment to do some corrections to generated images by removing glitches ie. speciment edge or non-hole blobs.\n";
