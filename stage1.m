### Stage one is to convert source images to grayscale,
### cut not-hole colours (grayscale values) ans split it into samples.
### no magic done here...

INFO = "After first run go to output_directory/images and check samples coords and histograms on image should be two peaks - one for holes (left one) and one for board color (right)\n firstPeak should be somewhere on the left from local minimum between two main peaks. \nsecondPeak - on the right. Change config variables if it is not. \n\nIf Your samples differs, change sample_coords. \nhint: use gimp to find coords and size or calculate it its important to remove (not include) anything that is not a hole ie. edge od sample. \n";
